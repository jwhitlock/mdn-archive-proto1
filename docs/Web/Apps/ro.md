<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/4627/fx-marketplace-icon.png" style="width: 175px; height: 175px; float: left;" />The idea of <span class="seoSummary">Open Web Apps</span> is to <span class="seoSummary">allow developers to create rich experiences that run across multiple devices and form factors</span> (desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.) <span class="seoSummary">using</span> the same <span class="seoSummary">Web standards</span> and open technologies that many of them will be accustomed to already, <span class="seoSummary">such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</span> Essentially, Open Web Apps are no different than normal Web pages or sites — in fact, they can be hosted as standard websites and accessed in the normal way — but the app model offers some significant advantages. As well as standard Web technologies, Open Web Apps feature additional metadata that allows the User Agent to discover, install, launch, and grant them additional privileges.</p>

  <h2 id="Advantages_of_Open_Web_Apps">Advantages of Open Web Apps</h2>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Local installation and offline storage</strong>: Open Web Apps can be installed on the device, and leverage APIs such as <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Storage" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Storage">local storage</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/IndexedDB" title="/en-US/docs/IndexedDB">IndexedDB</a> to provide local data storage capabilities. In addition, open Web technologies tend to have a much smaller footprint than native apps and can be updated atomically rather than having to install a complete new package each time there's an update. Such apps are therefore less dependent on an always-on Web connection, and more useful when networks are patchy.</li>
   <li><strong>Hardware access</strong>: The metadata provided with Open Web Apps can be used to grant the application permission to privileged APIs that enable usage of device hardware features, something the Web platform has not traditionally enjoyed.</li>
   <li><strong>Breaking the walled gardens</strong>: The norm for mobile platforms tends to be be walled gardens written with proprietary technologies, so apps are locked inside their platforms. And smartphones tend to be expensive, and require credit cards for app purchases. Open Web Apps tend to be able to run on much cheaper hardware, especially in the case of Firefox OS devices where you've literally just got Firefox running on top of a lightweight Linux kernel. And they are written using open Web technologies (like HTML5), which is the most distributed platform around. In addition, Firefox OS devices feature payment systems where you can simply prepay for apps, or add the cost to your phone bill.</li>
   <li><strong>Open Web App stores</strong>: Following from the previous point, you can choose to host your apps in an existing marketplace (such as the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/" title="https://marketplace.firefox.com/">Firefox Marketplace</a>), or host them somewhere else entirely. It's up to you. Mozilla aims to put the developer back in control of every aspect of the app experience — from easy development to distribution to direct customer relationship management. And the apps can be searched for just like any other Web-based experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Platforms_supporting_Open_Web_Apps">Platforms supporting Open Web Apps</h2>
  <p><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a> is Mozilla's exciting new Open Web App platform, which aims to deliver a smartphone experience to low cost handsets, and show how a mobile platform could be done in openness. But it doesn't stop there. Mozilla is offering Open Web App features like privileged APIs and manifests for standardization, and planning to roll out support for installing Open Web Apps on other platforms, like Firefox for desktop, Firefox for Android, and even other browsers.</p>
