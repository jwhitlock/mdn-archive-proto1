<p class="summary"><strong><dfn>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</dfn></strong> is an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Layer">application-layer</a> protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, though it can be used for other purposes as well. It follows a classical <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server model</a>, with a client opening a connection, making a request, and waiting until it receives a response. It is also a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol">stateless protocol</a>, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. Though often based on a TCP/IP layer, it can be used on any reliable <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer">transport layer</a>, that is a protocol that don't lose messages silently.</p>

 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">HTTP Cookies</a></dt>
 <dd>How cookies work is defined by <a class="external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265">RFC 6265</a>. On&nbsp;receiving an HTTP request, a server can send a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header with the response. Afterward, the client returns the cookie value&nbsp;with every request&nbsp;to the same server in the form of a <code>Cookie</code> HTTP header. Additionally, an expiration delay can be specified. The cookie can also be restricted to a specific domain and path.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS">HTTP Access Control (CORS)</a></dt>
 <dd><strong>Cross-site HTTP requests</strong> are HTTP requests for resources from a <strong>different domain</strong>&nbsp;other than the domain of the resource making the request. For instance, a resource loaded from Domain A (<code>http://domaina.example/</code>), such as an HTML web page, makes a request for a resource on Domain B (http://domainb.foo/), such as an image, using the <code>img</code> element (<code>http://domainb.foo/image.jpg</code>). This occurs very commonly on the web today â€” pages load many resources in a cross-site manner, including CSS stylesheets, images and scripts, and other resources.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Controlling_DNS_prefetching">Controlling DNS prefetching</a></dt>
 <dd>Firefox and most other modern browsers perform <strong>DNS prefetching</strong>. This is when browsers proactively perform domain name resolution on links that the user may choose to follow and resources referenced by the document, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript. This prefetching is performed in the background so that the DNS lookup is likely to have already been resolved by the time the referenced items are requested. This reduces latency when, for example, the user clicks a link.</dd>

 <dd>HTTP message headers are used to describe precisely the resource or the behavior of the server or the client. Custom proprietary headers can be added using the 'X-' prefix; others in an <a class="external" href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-headers.html">IANA registry</a>, whose original content was defined in <a class="external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4229">RFC 4229</a>. IANA also maintains a <a class="external" href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/prov-headers.html">registry of proposed new HTTP message headers</a>.</dd>
