<p class="summary">Welcome to the MDN Learning Area. This set of articles aims to provide complete beginners to web development with all they need to start coding simple websites.</p>
</div>

<p>The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable". From there you should be able to start making your way, learning from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">the rest of MDN</a>, and other intermediate to advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.</p>

<p>If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we will hold your hand&nbsp;and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web technologies work.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The content in the Learning Area is being added to regularly. If you have questions regarding topics you'd like to see covered or feel are missing, see the {{anch("Contact us")}} section below for information on how to get in touch.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Where_to_start">Where to start</h2>

<ul class="card-grid">
 <li><span>Complete beginner:</span> If you are a complete beginner to web development, we'd recommend that you start by working through our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">Getting started with the Web</a> module, which provides a practical introduction to web development.</li>
 <li><span>Specific questions:</span> If you have a specific question about web development, our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions">Common questions</a> section may have something to help you.</li>
 <li><span>Beyond the basics:</span> If you have a bit of knowledge already, the next step is to learn {{glossary("HTML")}} and {{glossary("CSS")}} in detail: start with our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a> module and move on to our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS">Introduction to CSS</a> module.</li>
 <li><span>Moving onto scripting:</span> If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS already, or you are mainly interested in coding, you'll want to move onto {{glossary("JavaScript")}} or server-side development. Begin with our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps">JavaScript first steps</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps">Server-side first steps</a> modules.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Our <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary">Glossary</a> provides terminology definitions.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We'll publish more core learning material in the future. Our "Advanced learning material" menu on the left points to other learning material on MDN, which isn't necessarily part of the Learning Area, but is still useful.</p>
</div>
