<p>The <strong>Mozilla Developer Network</strong> (MDN) is a wiki on which we document the open Web, Mozilla technologies, Firefox OS, and other developer topics. Anyone is welcome to add and edit content. You don't need to be a programmer or know a lot about technology; there are many different tasks that need to be performed, from the simple (proof-reading and correcting typos) to the complex (writing API documentation).</p>
<p>We need your help! It's easy. Don't worry about asking for permission or about making mistakes. On the other hand, please get to know the <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:Community" title="/en-US/docs/Project:Community">MDN community</a>; we're here to help you! The documentation below should get you started.</p>
