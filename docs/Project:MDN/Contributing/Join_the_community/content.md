<p>MDN is more than a wiki: It's a community of developers working together to make MDN an outstanding resource for developers who use open Web technologies. The "work" happens on the MDN site, but the "community" also happens through (asynchronous) discussion and (synchronous) online chat.</p>
<p>We'd love it if you contribute to MDN, but we'd love it even more if you participate in the MDN community. Here's how to get connected, in three easy steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an MDN account.</li>
  <li>Subscribe to dev-mdc discussions.</li>
  <li>Get into IRC.</li>
</ol>

<p>{{page("/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Getting_started", "Creating an account") }}</p>
<h2 id="Subscribe_to_dev-mdc_discussions">Subscribe to dev-mdc discussions</h2>
<p>The mailing list for discussing work on the content of MDN is <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdc" title="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdc">dev-mdc@lists.mozilla.org</a>. There are multiple ways that you can read the conversations, but if you want to post messages without waiting for a moderator to approve them, you must be subscribed to the mailing list. Here are the different ways you can access the mailing list:{{DiscussionList("dev-mdc", "mozilla.dev.mdc")}}</p>
<p>Why "dev-mdc"? In the past, this was known as "Mozilla Developer Center", or MDC. The mailing list dates back to that era, so it's dev-mdc. There's also a <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdn" title="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdn">dev-mdn</a> mailing list, which is for discussion about developing the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/kuma" title="https://github.com/mozilla/kuma">Kuma</a> platform that MDN runs on. You're welcome to join that, too, but it's not necessary if you're just interested in MDN content.</p>
<h2 id="Get_into_IRC">Get into IRC</h2>
<p>Like most parts of the Mozilla project, the MDN community uses <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> for online chat. The following IRC channels on irc.mozilla.org are relevant to MDN:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/devmo" title="irc://irc.mozilla.org/devmo">#devmo</a>: Discussions about content on MDN</li>
  <li><a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdndev" title="http://irc.mozilla.org/devmo">#mdndev</a>: Discussions about development of the MDN platform (also known as <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma">Kuma</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn" title="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn">#mdn</a>: Miscellaneous discussions; if you're not sure where to ask about something MDN-related, ask here.</li>
</ul>
<p>These channels are most likely to be active during weekdays in North America.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC" title="http://wiki.mozilla/org/IRC">Learn more about IRC</a> if you're not familiar with it. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/">ChatZilla</a> is an IRC client implemented as a Firefox add-on, which makes it quick and easy to install and start using it.</p>
<h2 id="Join_our_biweekly_meetings">Join our biweekly meetings</h2>
<p>Every other week, the MDN community holds an IRC-based meeting to exchange notes, talk about what we've been doing, and sort out what we'd like to do for the next two weeks. We also talk about development plans for the MDN platform itself, and often get updates about new and upcoming features of the site. These are casual, fun meetings, and everyone's welcome to participate.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Community_meetings" title="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Community_meetings">MDN Community Meetings</a> page on the Mozilla wiki for details on the schedule as well as agendas and notes for past and upcoming meetings.</p>
