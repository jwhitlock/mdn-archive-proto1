<p>The <strong>Mozilla Developer Network</strong> (MDN) is a wiki on which we document the open Web, Mozilla technologies, Firefox OS, and other developer topics. Anyone is welcome to add and edit content. You don't need to be a programmer or know a lot about technology; there are many different tasks that need to be performed, from the simple (proof-reading and correcting typos) to the complex (writing API documentation).</p>

<div class="summary">
<p>The goal of the MDN project is to document the Open Web, Mozilla technologies, and Mozilla projects. We invite you to help!</p>
