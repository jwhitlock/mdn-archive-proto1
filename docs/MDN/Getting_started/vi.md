<p id="What_is_MDN.3F">We are an open community of developers building resources for a better Web, regardless of brand, browser, or platform. Anyone can contribute and each person who does makes us stronger. Together we can continue to drive innovation on the Web to serve the greater good. It starts here, with you.</p>

<p><span>Every part of MDN (docs, demos, and the site itself) are created by an open community of developers, but it wouldn't be anything without your help too!</span></p>

<h2 id="3_simple_steps_to_MDN"><span>3 simple steps to MDN</span></h2>

<p><span class="seoSummary">MDN is a wiki, where <strong>anyone</strong> can add and edit content. You don't need to be a programmer or know a lot about technologies. There are plenty of things that need to be done, from the simple (proofreading and correcting typos) to the complex (writing API documentation).</span></p>

<p>Contributing is easy and safe. Even if you make a mistake, it's easily fixed. Even if you don't know exactly how things should look, or your grammar isn't all that good, don't worry about it! We have a team of people whose job it is to make sure that MDN's contents are as good as possible. Someone will be along to make sure your work is tidy and well-written. Share what you know and follow your strengths.</p>

<h3 id="Step_1_Create_an_account_on_MDN">Step 1: Create an account on MDN</h3>

<p>To begin your contributions to MDN, you need to have an account on MDN. For details, please see <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Create_an_MDN_account">how to create an account</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Step_2_Pick_a_task_to_complete">Step 2: Pick a task to complete</h3>

<p>Now that you are logged in, read the descriptions of different task types in {{anch("Possible task types", "the list below")}}, and decide which one most appeals to you. You can pick any task you like and begin your contribution.</p>

<h3 id="Step_3_Do_the_task">Step 3: Do the task</h3>

<p>Once you've decided what kind of task you want to do, find a specific page, code example, etc. to work on, and just do it!</p>

<p>Don't worry about doing it perfectly; other MDN contributors are here to help fix errors that slip through. If you have questions as you go, see the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Community">Community</a> page for info on mailing lists and chat channels where you can get answers.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you want to experiment with editing on MDN before doing something "for real", we have a <strong><a href="/en-US/docs/Sandbox">Sandbox</a></strong> page for you to play around in. Please limit your experiments to this page. Please don't make unneeded changes to content pages just to see what happens; that's making a mess for others to clean up.</p>
</div>

<p>When you're done with your chosen task, feel free to pick another item, or see below for <a href="#Other_things_you_can_do_on_MDN">other things you can do on MDN</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Possible_task_types">Possible task types</h2>

<p>There are multiple avenues you can take to contribute to MDN depending on your skill set and interests. Even though some tasks may be daunting, we do have lots of simple activities available. A lot of them need only five minutes (or less!) of your time. Along with the task and its short description, you will find the approximate time that each type of task typically takes.</p>
