<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>

<div class="summary">
<p>MDN (which is an abbreviation for Mozilla Developer Network) is more than a wiki: It's a community of developers working together to make MDN an outstanding resource for developers who use open Web technologies. The "work" happens on the MDN site, but the "community" also happens through (asynchronous) discussion and (synchronous) online chat.</p>
</div>

<p>We'd love it if you contribute to MDN, but we'd love it even more if you participate in the MDN community. Here's how to get connected, in three easy steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create an MDN account.</li>
 <li>Subscribe to dev-mdc discussions.</li>
 <li>Get into IRC.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Join_our_mailing_lists">Join our mailing lists</h2>

<p>To share information and have ongoing discussions, Mozilla has several useful <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo">mailing lists</a>. Those that are particular to MDN are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdc">dev-mdc</a></dt>
 <dd>This list is where we have ongoing discussions about documentation on MDN. We talk about process changes, improvements we've made, and we sort out who would like to work on which content. It's <strong>highly recommended</strong> that you join this list if you're interested in seriously diving into documentation on MDN! (Why "dev-mdc"? In the past, this site was known as "Mozilla Developer Center", or MDC. The mailing list dates back to that era, so it's dev-mdc.)</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdn">dev-mdn</a></dt>
 <dd>This list is where we hold discussions about the development work on MDN's underlying <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma">Kuma</a> platform. If you're curious about the development work going on behind the scenes, want to be involved in the process of making decsisions about the platform, or are working on patches to improve the platform, you should definitely get involved on this list.</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/mdn">mdn</a></dt>
 <dd>This mailing list is high-level planning and prioritization discussions, for the MDN website and other related initiatives.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There are also a few lists specific to MDN localization communities. If your community is very large and active, you can probably get a list created for your community; just ask us and we'll look into it. Currently, these languages have lists: <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdc-es">Spanish</a>, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla-translations-ja">Japanese</a>, and <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdc-pt">Portuguese</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Get_into_IRC">Get into IRC</h2>

<p>Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is our preferred method for day-to-day chat and real-time discussions among community members. We use a few channels on the server irc.mozilla.org for discussions related to MDN.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn" title="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn">#mdn</a></dt>
 <dd>This channel is our primary channel for discussing the content of MDN. We talk about writing, organization of content, and so on. We also have "water cooler" conversations here—it's a way our community can keep in touch and just hang out. This is also the place to talk about other aspects of MDN (other than development of the platform), such as Demo Studio, profiles, and so on.</dd>
 <dt><a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdndev" title="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdndev">#mdndev</a></dt>
 <dd>This channel is where our development team—the people that write the code that makes MDN work—hangs out and discusses their day-to-day work. You're welcome to join in and either participate in the development or simply ask questions about issues you see with the software.</dd>
</dl>

<p>These channels are most likely to be active during weekdays in North America.</p>

<p>You may want to <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC" title="http://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">learn more about IRC</a> and use an installable IRC client such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/">ChatZilla</a>. It is implemented as a Firefox add-on, which makes it quick and easy to install and use. If you're not familiar with IRC, an easy way to join is using a web-based IRC client such as <a href="http://web.scrollback.io/" target="_blank">Scrollback</a>, which is pre-configured with the <a href="http://scrollback.io/mozdn/" target="_blank">mdn</a> and <a href="http://scrollback.io/mdndev/" target="_blank">mdndev</a> channels.</p>

<h2 id="Join_our_biweekly_meetings_(and_other_events)">Join our biweekly meetings (and other events)</h2>

<p>Every other week, the MDN community holds an IRC-based meeting to exchange notes, talk about what we've been doing, and sort out what we'd like to do for the next two weeks. We also talk about development plans for the MDN platform itself, and often get updates about new and upcoming features of the site. These are casual, fun meetings, and everyone's welcome to participate.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Meetings/Community" title="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Community_meetings">MDN Community Meetings</a> page on the Mozilla wiki for details on the schedule as well as agendas and notes for past and upcoming meetings.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mozilla.com_2d35383434313235392d323530%40resource.calendar.google.com">MDN Events calendar</a> for these and other meetings, doc sprints, and other events. The recurring meetings are summarized on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Meetings">MDN Meetings wiki page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Project_administrators">Project administrators</h2>

<p>You can contact an MDN project administrator by email. If you wish to talk to the MDN documentation lead, his name is {{UserLink("Sheppy", "Eric Shepherd")}}, and he's happy to try to answer your questions, or help you find the right person to do so.</p>
