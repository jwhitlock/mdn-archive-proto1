<p>Welcome to MDN! <span class="seoSummary">If you have suggestions for, or are having problems using MDN, this is the right place to be.

<h2 id="Update_the_documentation">Atualizar a documentação</h2>

<p>First of all, if you've seen a problem with the documentation, you should always feel free to correct it yourself. Simply <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Create_an_MDN_account">sign in</a> using <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, then click any blue <strong>Edit</strong> button to open the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor">editor</a> and enter the world of contributing to MDN documentation. The documentation here is in a wiki, and is curated by a team of volunteers and paid staff, so don't be shy—your grammar doesn't have to be perfect. We'll clean it up if you make a mistake; no harm done!</p>
