<p>Welcome to the Mozilla Developer Network! <span class="seoSummary">If you have suggestions for, or are having problems using MDN, this is the right place to be.

<h2 id="Update_the_documentation">Update the documentation</h2>

<p>First of all, if you've seen a problem with the documentation, you should always feel free to correct it yourself. Simply <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Create_an_MDN_account">sign in</a> using <a href="https://www.persona.org/" title="/en-US/docs/">Persona</a> or <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, then click any blue <strong>Edit</strong> button to open the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor">editor</a> and enter the world of contributing to MDN documentation. The documentation here is in a wiki, and is curated by a team of volunteers and paid staff, so don't be shy â€” your grammar doesn't have to be perfect. We'll clean it up if you make a mistake; no harm done!</p>

<p>Longer-term discussions happen on our mailing list, <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdc" title="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-mdc">dev-mdc@lists.mozilla.org</a>. You can post to the list without subscribing to it, but in that case, your post must be approved by a moderator, which means it will take longer for others to see it.
