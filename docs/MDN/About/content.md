<p>The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is an evolving learning platform for Web technologies and the software that powers the Web, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Web standards such as <a href="/en-US/docs/CSS" title="/en-US/docs/CSS">CSS</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/HTML" title="/en-US/docs/HTML">HTML</a>, and <a href="/en-US/docs/JavaScript" title="/en-US/docs/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Apps" title="/en-US/docs/Apps">Open Web app development</a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Add-ons" title="/en-US/docs/Add-ons">Firefox add-on development</a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS development</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Our_mission">Our mission</h2>
<p>MDN's mission is simple: to provide complete, accurate, and helpful documentation for everything about the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web">open Web</a>, whether it's supported by Mozilla-built software or not. If it's an open technology exposed to the Web, we want to document it.</p>
<p>In addition, we provide documentation about how to <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla">build and contribute to Mozilla projects</a> and about <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a> and <a href="/en-US/Apps">Web app development</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not sure whether a particular topic should be covered on MDN, read: <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Does_this_belong">Does this belong on MDN?</a></p>
<h2 id="How_you_can_help">How you can help</h2>
<p>You don't need to be able to code—or to write—in order to be able to help MDN! We have lots of ways you can help, from reviewing articles to be sure they make sense, to contributing text, to adding sample code. In fact, there are so many ways to help that we have an actual <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Quick_start">tool to help you pick tasks to help</a>, based on your interests and how much time you have to spare!</p>
<h2 id="The_MDN_community">The MDN community</h2>
<p>Our community is a global one! We have amazing contributors all around the world, in a number of languages. If you'd like to learn more about us, or if you need help of any kind with MDN, feel free to check out our mailing list or IRC channel !</p>

<h2 id="Download_content">Download content</h2>
<p>You can retrieve the content of a single page on MDN by adding <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Kuma/API#Document_parameters">document parameters</a> to the URL to specify what format you want.</p>
<p>We are not currently able to provide database dumps of MDN's content due to privacy concerns for our users. We will try to come up with a way to provide a similar capability in the future.</p>
<h3 id="Third-party_tools">Third-party tools</h3>
<p>You can also view MDN content via third-party tools like <a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> (for Mac OS) and <a href="http://zealdocs.org/">Zeal</a> (for Linux and Windows).</p>
<h2 id="Reporting_problems_with_MDN">Reporting problems with MDN</h2>
<p>Now and then, you may run into problems while using MDN. Whether it's a problem with site infrastructure or an error in documentation content, you can either try to fix it yourself or report the problem. While the former is preferred, the latter is sometimes the best you can manage, and that's okay too.</p>
<h3 id="Documentation_errors">Documentation errors</h3>
<p>Obviously, since MDN is a wiki, the best thing you can possibly do is fix problems you spot yourself. But maybe you don't know the answer or are in the middle of rushing to the hospital or something, and need to jot down the problem so someone can look at it later.</p>
<p>As is the case with all things Mozilla, you report a documentation problem by filing a bug. That's when filing a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.doc">documentation request bug</a> comes in. Our handy documentation request form will gather the information needed to get us started on fixing the issue.</p>
<p>Of course, our writing community is busy, so sometimes the quickest way to see a documentation problem resolved is to fix it yourself. See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Creating_and_editing_pages" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Creating_and_editing_pages">Creating and editing pages</a> for details.</p>
<h3 id="Site_bugs_or_feature_requests">Site bugs or feature requests</h3>
<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma">Kuma</a>, the Mozilla-developed platform used for the MDN web site, is in a state of continuous development. Our developers—as well as a number of volunteer contributors—are constantly making improvements. If you see a bug, or have a problem with the site, or even have a suggestion for something that could make the software more awesome, you can use the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.mdn" title="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.mdn">Kuma bug form</a> to file a report.</p>
<h2 id="History_of_MDN">History of MDN</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Developer Network (a.k.a. Mozilla Developer Center (MDC), a.k.a. <em>Devmo</em>) project started in early 2005, when the <a class="external" href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org">Mozilla Foundation</a> obtained a license from AOL to use the original <a href="/Project:en/DevEdge" title="Project:en/DevEdge">DevEdge</a> content. The DevEdge content was mined for still-useful material, which was then migrated by volunteers into this wiki so it would be easier to update and maintain.</p>
<p>Since then, the project has continued growing and now forms a central nexus for all developer documentation related to the Mozilla Project and open web technologies. In 2010, the name was changed to Mozilla Developer Network; 2011 saw the addition of <a class="external" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/">Demo Studio</a> for web developers to share and show off their code, and <a class="external" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn">Learning</a> pages to provide links to tutorials. (The name MDC lives on as "MDN Doc Center" for the documentation section.) In time, it is hoped that the Mozilla Developer Network will become a resource that web designers, application developers, and extension and theme writers visit on a regular basis.</p>
