<h2 id="Our_mission">Our mission</h2>

<p>MDN's mission is simple: to provide developers with the information they need to easily build projects on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web">open Web</a>. If it's an open technology exposed to the Web, we want to document it.</p>

<p>In addition, we provide documentation about <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla">Mozilla products</a> and how to <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla">build and contribute to Mozilla projects</a>. We also cover the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/B2G_OS">B2G OS</a> (formerly Firefox OS).</p>

<p>If you're not sure whether a particular topic should be covered on MDN, read: <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Does_this_belong">Does this belong on MDN?</a></p>

<h2 id="How_you_can_help">How you can help</h2>

<p>You don't need to be able to code—or to write well—in order to be able to help MDN! We have lots of ways you can help, from reviewing articles to be sure they make sense, to contributing text, to adding sample code. In fact, there are so many ways to help that we have a <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Getting_started">Getting Started</a> page that helps you pick tasks to do, based on your interests and how much time you have to spare!</p>

<p>You can also help by <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/About/Promote">promoting MDN</a> on your own blog or website.</p>

<h2 id="History_of_MDN">History of MDN</h2>

<p>The Mozilla Developer Network (a.k.a. Mozilla Developer Center (MDC), a.k.a. <em>Devmo</em>) project started in early 2005, when the <a class="external" href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org">Mozilla Foundation</a> obtained a license from AOL to use the original Netscape <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/devedge.netscape.com" title="Project:en/DevEdge">DevEdge</a> content. The DevEdge content was mined for still-useful material, which was then migrated by volunteers into this wiki so it would be easier to update and maintain.</p>

<p>You can find more history of MDN on our <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN_at_ten">10th anniversary celebration</a> page, including an oral history by some of the people who were involved.</p>
