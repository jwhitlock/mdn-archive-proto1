<p>A Rede de Desenvolvedores da&nbsp;Mozilla (MDN)&nbsp;é uma plataforma de aprendizagem em evolução para tecnologias da Web e o software que alimenta a Web, incluindo:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Padrões web como&nbsp;<a href="/en-US/docs/CSS" title="/en-US/docs/CSS">CSS</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/HTML" title="/en-US/docs/HTML">HTML</a>, e&nbsp;<a href="/en-US/docs/JavaScript" title="/en-US/docs/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Apps" title="/en-US/docs/Apps">Open Web app&nbsp;development</a>&nbsp;</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Add-ons" title="/en-US/docs/Add-ons">Firefox add-on development</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Nossa_missão">Nossa missão</h2>

<p>A missão da MDN é simples: prover uma completa, exata e&nbsp;<span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="pt"><span class="hps">útil documentação para tudo sobre a open Web</span></span>, <span id="result_box" lang="pt"><span class="hps">sendo ele construído, </span><span class="hps">suportado</span> <span class="hps">ou não pela Mozilla</span><span class="hps">.</span> <span class="hps">Se é</span> <span class="hps">uma tecnologia aberta</span> <span class="hps">e </span><span class="hps">Web</span><span>, queremos</span> <span class="hps">documentá-lo</span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p>Além disso, podemos fornecer a documentação sobre como <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla">desenvolver e contribuir com os projetos da Mozilla</a>, <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a> e <a href="/en-US/Apps">desenvolvimento de Web app</a>.</p>

<p>Se você não tem certeza se um tópico específico deve ser abordado no MDN leia: <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Does_this_belong">Isso pertence ao MDN?</a></p>

<h2 id="Como_você_pode_ajudar">Como você pode ajudar</h2>

<p>Você não precisa ser capaz de programar - or escrever - para poder ajudar a MDN! Nós temos muitos caminhos por onde você pode ajudar, de uma revisão de artigos para ter certeza que fazem sentido, até contribuindo com texto, adicionando códigos de exemplo. Na verdade existem tantas formas de ajudar que nós temos uma <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Quick_start">ferramenta para ajudá-lo a escolher tarefas para ajudar</a>, baseada em seus interesses e na sua quantidade de tempo livre.</p>

<h2 id="A_comunidade_MDN">A comunidade MDN</h2>

<h2 id="Baixar_conteúdo">Baixar conteúdo</h2>

<p>You can retrieve the content of a single page on MDN by adding <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/API#Document_parameters">document parameters</a> to the URL to specify what format you want.</p>

<p>If you want to download a complete, anonymized SQL dump of the MDN database -- that is, a copy of the database with all private user information scrubbed out, we provide that as well. This dump is updated on the first day of each month.</p>

<p>There are three archives that comprise the anonymized monthly dump of MDN:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>&lt;date&gt;.sanitized.devmo_sanitize.sql.gz</code></dt>
 <dd>The sanitized MySQL database dump of all of MDN's content, data records, and so forth. This is all article content, history records, and so forth. All personal user information has been stripped out (such as email addresses).</dd>
 <dt><code>attachments-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz</code></dt>
 <dd>This archive contains all the file attachments that have been uploaded to the wiki.</dd>
 <dt><code>uploads-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz</code></dt>
 <dd>This (very large!) archive contains the files uploaded to the Demo Studio. If your interest is only in wiki content, you don't need to download this.</dd>
</dl>

<p><a href="https://developer.allizom.org/landfill/">Visit the MDN landfill</a> to download these files.</p>

<h3 id="Ferramentas_de_terceiros">Ferramentas de terceiros</h3>

<p>You can also view MDN content via third-party tools like <a href="http://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> (for Mac OS) and <a href="http://zealdocs.org/">Zeal</a> (for Linux and Windows).</p>

<h2 id="Informando_problemas_com_MDN">Informando problemas com&nbsp;MDN</h2>

<p>Now and then, you may run into problems while using MDN. Whether it's a problem with site infrastructure or an error in documentation content, you can either try to fix it yourself or report the problem. While the former is preferred, the latter is sometimes the best you can manage, and that's okay too.</p>

<h3 id="Erros_na_documentação">Erros na documentação</h3>

<p>Obviously, since MDN is a wiki, the best thing you can possibly do is fix problems you spot yourself. But maybe you don't know the answer or are in the middle of rushing to the hospital or something, and need to jot down the problem so someone can look at it later.</p>

<p>As is the case with all things Mozilla, you report a documentation problem by filing a bug. That's when filing a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.doc">documentation request bug</a> comes in. Our handy documentation request form will gather the information needed to get us started on fixing the issue.</p>

<p>Of course, our writing community is busy, so sometimes the quickest way to see a documentation problem resolved is to fix it yourself. See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Creating_and_editing_pages" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Creating_and_editing_pages">Creating and editing pages</a> for details.</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma">Kuma</a>, the Mozilla-developed platform used for the MDN web site, is in a state of continuous development. Our developers—as well as a number of volunteer contributors—are constantly making improvements. If you see a bug, or have a problem with the site, or even have a suggestion for something that could make the software more awesome, you can use the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.mdn" title="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.mdn">Kuma bug form</a> to file a report.</p>

<h2 id="História_da_MDN">História da&nbsp;MDN</h2>

<p>The Mozilla Developer Network (a.k.a. Mozilla Developer Center (MDC), a.k.a. <em>Devmo</em>) project started in early 2005, when the <a class="external" href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org">Mozilla Foundation</a> obtained a license from AOL to use the original <a href="/Project:en/DevEdge" title="Project:en/DevEdge">DevEdge</a> content. The DevEdge content was mined for still-useful material, which was then migrated by volunteers into this wiki so it would be easier to update and maintain.</p>

<p>Since then, the project has continued growing and now forms a central nexus for all developer documentation related to the Mozilla Project and open web technologies. In 2010, the name was changed to Mozilla Developer Network; 2011 saw the addition of <a class="external" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/">Demo Studio</a> for web developers to share and show off their code, and <a class="external" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn">Learning</a> pages to provide links to tutorials. (The name MDC lives on as "MDN Doc Center" for the documentation section.) In time, it is hoped that the Mozilla Developer Network will become a resource that web designers, application developers, and extension and theme writers visit on a regular basis.</p>
