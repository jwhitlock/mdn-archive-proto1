<p class="summary"><strong>Technical review</strong> consists of reviewing the technical accuracy and completeness of an article, and correcting it if necessary. If a writer of an article wants someone else to check the technical content of an article, the writer ticks the "Technical review" checkbox while editing. Often the writer contacts a specific engineer to perform the technical review, but anyone with technical expertise in the topic can do one.</p>
<p><span class="seoSummary">This article describes how to go about perfoming a technical review, thereby helping to ensure that MDN's content is accurate.</span></p>
