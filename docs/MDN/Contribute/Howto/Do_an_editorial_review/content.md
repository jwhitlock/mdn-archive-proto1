<p class="summary"><strong>Editorial review</strong> consists of fixing typos and spelling, grammar, usage, or textual errors in an article. Not all contributors are language experts, but due to their knowledge have contributed extremely useful articles, which need copy-editing and proof-reading; this is done in the editorial review.</p>
